## Overview
This project focuses on examining Stack Overflow data from 2017 to explore various facets:

1. **Evaluation of Developer Involvement**: Understanding the extent of developer engagement on Stack Overflow.
2. **Correlation Between Developer Salaries and Platform Engagement**: Investigating potential links between a developer's income and their activity level on the platform.
3. **Impact of User Account Status on Behavior**: Analyzing how a user's account status affects their behavior and utilization of the platform.

## Q1: Evaluation of Developer Involvement
To evaluate developer engagement, the survey incorporated questions related to users' activities on Stack Overflow. Categorized responses shed light on three primary user behaviors: utilizing code-related information, job-seeking activities, and content creation.

### Findings:
- Notable trends emerged from the survey data, indicating consistent engagement levels in finding answers and copying code.
- Majority of respondents displayed limited involvement in job-seeking or content creation, suggesting a predominant focus on seeking code-related assistance.
- A significant portion habitually sought code solutions at least once a week, indicating a larger group of moderately active users relying on the platform for valuable information.

## Q2: Correlation Between Salaries and Platform Engagement
Initial assumptions about a potential link between higher platform activity and developer salaries were disproven through correlation analyses. However, intriguing correlations were observed among different user behaviors on Stack Overflow, particularly between asking and answering questions.

## Q3: Impact of User Account Status on Behavior
User account status significantly influenced behavior patterns. Segregation of data based on account status revealed distinct engagement levels across user groups. Notably, users with CV or Developer Story exhibited higher job-seeking tendencies.

## Key Observations
- Consistent engagement in finding answers and code copying regardless of account registration.
- Variations in job-seeking and content creation activities among different user groups.
- Users with CVs or Developer Stories demonstrate higher inclination towards job-seeking.

### Conclusion
The analysis suggests minimal correlation between developer salaries and platform engagement. However, account status influences user behavior, indicating potential insights for targeted ad serving.
